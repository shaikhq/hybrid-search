"""
hybrid_core.py — the hybrid-search engine, shared by 6_search.py (CLI) and
eval.py (metrics). It has no command line of its own.

Three retrieval legs, all in Db2:
  - lexical : Db2 Text Search keyword match, ranked by BM25 SCORE()
  - vector  : Db2 VECTOR column vs the query embedded by watsonx (TO_EMBEDDING)
  - hybrid  : a GATED, SCORE-NORMALIZED fusion of the two

Why not plain RRF?  RRF fuses on rank only and throws away each leg's
confidence, so a leg that is essentially guessing (vectors on an exact error
code, BM25 on a pure paraphrase) injects its top guesses with the same weight as
the other leg's real hits — and they tie. Instead we:
  1. carry each leg's real score (BM25 SCORE, cosine similarity),
  2. max-normalize it (s / max) within the query's candidate pool,
  3. GATE a leg out when its best score is below a threshold (a near-random leg
     contributes nothing), and
  4. take a weighted sum of the surviving normalized scores.
A document found by *both* legs is reinforced; a noisy leg is muted.
