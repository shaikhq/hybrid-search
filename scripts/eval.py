eval.py — measure retrieval quality on a small GOLDEN EVAL SET.

The golden eval set below is a set of relevance judgments (a.k.a. *qrels* in
information-retrieval terms): each query is paired with its known-relevant
chunk(s). Reports MRR, Recall@K and Hits@1 for each leg (lexical, vector,
hybrid), plus a per-query table of where the first relevant result landed. Run it
after any change to chunking, the embedding model, the fusion gates, or the
weights, and judge the change by the numbers instead of by eyeballing one query.

    ./scripts/eval.sh        # runs as the Db2 instance owner, local connection

The labels are loaded from the shared ui/queries.json so the eval and the demo
UI use the SAME curated set. They're for the IBM Db2 12.1.5 LLM-integration
reference doc; replace queries.json for your own corpus.
