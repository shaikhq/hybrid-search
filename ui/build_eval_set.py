build_eval_set.py — freeze the gold passages for the FEATURED eval queries into
eval_set.json, so the "Golden eval set" page in the UI can show, for each demo
question, the exact Db2-docs passage(s) that search is expected to return —
fully offline, no Db2 needed at view time.

Run it via ui/build_eval_set.sh (as the Db2 instance owner, local connection).
Reads queries.json and writes eval_set.json, both in this script's directory.
